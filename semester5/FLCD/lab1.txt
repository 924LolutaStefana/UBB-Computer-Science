p1. Compute the sum of the first n numbers, n is an integer 

n isequal read({Enter a number})
sum isequal 0
for number from 1 to n+1, step 1
    sum isequal sum+number
output({Sum of first ^n numbers is : ^sum})

p2.Compute the average of the first n numbers, n is an integer

n isequal read({Enter a number})
sum isequal 0
for number from 1 to n+1, step 1
    sum isequal sum+number
average isequal sum /// n
output({Average of first ^n numbers is : ^average})

p3. Verify if a given number n is prime 
n = read({Enter a number})
if  cond[n > 1] then 
	for i from 2 to n, step 1 
		if cond[n /% i] isequalto 0
			output({^n is not a prime number})
			getout
		otherwise 
			output({^n is a prime number})

otherwise
	output({^n is not a prime number})


p4err. Verify if a given number n is prime (with 2 mistakes)
n = read({Enter a number})
if  n > 1 then      ### this is a mistake, it should be of form if cond[condition]
	for i from 2 to n, step 1 
		if cond[n /% i] isequalto 0
			output({^n is not a prime number})
			getout
		otherwise 
			output("n is a prime number") ###mistake, it should be of form output({})

otherwise
	output({^n is not a prime number})
